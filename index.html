      <h1>What is Luck?</h1>
      <p>Luck is a simple card game. The objective is to play higher cards than your opponent, which is entirely dependent on luck. To play Luck, you need the following: <br>
<br>Two players <br>
A standard deck of 52 cards<br><br>
Start by dealing out the deck one card at a time, face-down, so that each player gets 26 cards. Keep your cards in a pile and don’t look at them. Each player turns over one card simultaneously; whoever turns over the highest card gains that card's value in points.<br>
The cards have the normal rank from highest to lowest: ace, king, queen, jack, and then 10 through 2. <br>
When both players run out of cards, you have three possible outcomes: Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or there is a tie.<br>
If a tie results, repeat the process until someone achieves a decisive victory.<br><br>
